# Changelog

All notable changes to the Edge Veda Flutter SDK will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Seamless XCFramework distribution:** Native C engines (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp) now auto-fetched via CocoaPods trunk — zero manual steps for consumers. Just `flutter pub add edge_veda` and `flutter build ios`.
- **EdgeVedaCore pod:** Separate CocoaPods pod for binary XCFramework distribution via GitHub Releases
- **publish-pod.sh:** Release automation script for CocoaPods trunk publishing
- **119 unit tests:** TextCleaner, JsonRecovery, SchemaValidator, RuntimePolicy, Budget, LatencyTracker, MemoryEstimator

### Changed
- XCFramework delivery: from manual `curl` download to automatic CocoaPods dependency resolution
- `edge_veda.podspec` now declares `s.dependency 'EdgeVedaCore', '~> 2.3'` instead of bundling the binary

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **TTS hang prevention:** `TtsService.speak()` now includes a 30-second safety timeout — if iOS never fires the finish/cancel delegate (phone call, Bluetooth disconnect, memory pressure), the voice pipeline recovers instead of freezing forever
- **TTS resource cleanup:** Subscription and timer properly cleaned up via `try/finally` on all exit paths, preventing leaks on unexpected exceptions
- **Voice pipeline dispose crash:** All event emissions now guarded against closed `StreamController`, preventing `StateError` crash when `dispose()` races with async turn processing
- **Mic re-enable after stop():** `_micListening` flag now correctly stays `false` if `stop()` or `pause()` is called during the post-TTS cooldown delay
- **sendNow() error state:** Push-to-talk error handler no longer incorrectly recovers from `error` state back to `listening`
- **Cooldown skip on early returns:** Empty transcript, QoS paused, and LLM error paths no longer wait 800ms before resuming the microphone

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Text-to-Speech:** `TtsService` wrapping iOS AVSpeechSynthesizer via platform channels — zero binary size increase
- Speak, stop, pause, resume with voice/rate/pitch/volume control
- Real-time word boundary events via EventChannel for text highlighting
- Neural/enhanced voice filtering (iOS 16+ high-quality voices)
- `TtsVoice`, `TtsEvent`, `TtsEventType`, `TtsState` types exported
- TTS demo screen with voice picker, rate/pitch sliders, and live word highlighting
- Completes the voice pipeline: STT → LLM → TTS

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Image generation Scheduler integration:** `WorkloadId.image` registered with central Scheduler for QoS-gated generation, latency tracking, and thermal/battery awareness
- **Cross-worker memory eviction:** Scheduler auto-disposes lowest-priority idle workers when RSS exceeds memory ceiling by >10% — prevents OOM on constrained devices
- **Image idle auto-disposal:** SD model (2.3 GB) automatically freed after 60 seconds of inactivity
- **Image progress callbacks fixed:** `NativeCallable.isolateLocal` replaces `.listener` — per-step progress now fires in real-time during generation
- **Strict schema validation:** `SchemaValidator.validateStrict()` rejects extra keys at any nesting depth
- **JSON recovery:** `JsonRecovery.tryRepair()` auto-fixes truncated/malformed model output (unclosed brackets, trailing garbage, unterminated strings)
- **Validation telemetry:** `ValidationEvent` emitted on every `sendStructured()` call with pass/fail, recovery details, and timing

### Fixed
- Image generation: keep SD model weights alive across multiple generations (was crashing on 2nd image with GGML_ASSERT(buft) due to free_params_immediately freeing CLIP/UNet/VAE buffers)

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- Image generation: keep SD model weights alive across multiple generations (was crashing on 2nd image with GGML_ASSERT(buft) due to free_params_immediately freeing CLIP/UNet/VAE buffers)

### Fixed

### Performance
- Text generation: 42–43 tok/s sustained (Llama 3.2 1B, Metal GPU)
